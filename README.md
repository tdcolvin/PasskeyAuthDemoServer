# Passkey demo app on Android

This app demonstrates a full end-to-end passkey implementation with a NodeJS server and Javascript front-end, using [SimpleWebAuthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev/). The code is an express application, but re-jigged to work with Firebase.

This also works with the Android implementation at https://github.com/tdcolvin/PasskeyAuthDemoAndroid.

This code is also running here: auth.tomcolvin.co.uk.

Please open an issue if you hit any problems. And if you need help implementing passkeys in your own app then I'm [available as a freelancer](https://www.tomcolvin.co.uk) üòÅ.
